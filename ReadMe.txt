DO NOT USE ON ANY OTHER WINDOWS VERSION EXCEPT XP

Using Win2K CPL Port WinXP v1.exe install:
-Run Win2K CPL Port WinXP v1.exe, select your Windows XP c:/windows/, open newfound windows folder in c:\windows\windows\ 
-keep one explorer window at c:\windows\windows open, and another window at c:\windows\
-move c:\windows\explorer.exe to desktop, move c:\windows\windows\explorer.exe to c:\windows\
-Navigate to c:\windows\system32\ in one window, and to c:\windows\windows\system32 in another
-One at a time & in short time frame between moving file to desktop, then moving the replacement file is the most effective way  
-follow the procedure you did with explorer.exe, except with the files found in c:\windows\windows\system32
   ex: move access.cpl from c:\windows\system32 to desktop, in small time frame move c:\windows\windows\system32\access.cpl to c:\windows\system32\
       continue this pattern with the rest of the files in c:\windows\windows\system32 ONE AT A TIME, with proper care for bypassing windows file protection taken

Using .zip Install:
-all files included in the installer are in the provided WINDOWS.zip folder. Copy what's in the root directory of 
 said WINDOWS folder to your WinXP C:\Windows\ and what is in the System32 folder to your 
 C:\Windows\System32\ 

[if when running the installer you select c:\, this should move the file write process to overwrite the system files, but 
the installer v1.0 fails to do so, working on a v2.0, but in the meantime you can still use it, just a lot more hands on of a process (see line 9 'Using Win2K CPL Port WinXP v1.exe: install')]
