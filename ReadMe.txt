WINDOWS 2000 PROFESSIONAL CONTROL PANEL PORT, BOOT, & BANNERS README:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using Setup.exe:
-Boot Screen V1.0, color mode errors, but at the least it wont say Windows XP after this (uses OEM Windows 2000 boot screen bmp)

Using Manual Install:
-If you are worried about NTOSKERNAL errors, you may bypass the installation of ntoskrnl.exe
 by manually copying the files and avoiding ntoskrnl.exe and ntkrnlpa.exe, all files included
 in the installer are in the provided WINDOWS folder. Copy what's in the root directory of 
 said WINDOWS folder to your WinXP C:\Windows\ and what is in the System32 folder to your 
 C:\Windows\System32\
